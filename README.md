Barebones Angular Form with the ability to add, remove, and list out favorite things!

This is my first foray back into Angular since early 2015-ish.

Notes:
- App was bootstrapped using `angular-seed` for the base app.
- There is no data persistence, but if there were, I would imagine that some API requests would occur on Add + Remove button clicks.
- I kept this super simple without bringing in any other libraries or packages to refresh my memory on things.

Todo:
- Move the add fields into an ngForm directive.  This will allow me to use it's validators too instead of writing my own dinky ones.
- Better styling, maybe responsive design?  Maybe?  Definitely not my forte.  Good exploration topic.
- More e2e testing.  Need to learn me some protractor.
